# ❴❵ JSON-Feed
JSON Feed RSS for Textpattern CMS (v4.7+)

Full standalone template page (no plugin needed: smd_thumbnail is optional).

`<txp::config />` is a form created to store some global TXP variables (this template uses only one: `<txp:variable name="blog_pages" />` in order to set your blog (articles) section name.

Create a page named `rss-feed` and copy/past the entire template in it. Attach this page to a `rss-feed` section. Done!
